To-do

## Windows

1. Download Visual Studio 2019. In the installer, ensure that you choose the "Desktop development with C++" workload. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160
This will take a while. You can perform steps 2 to 4 while VS2019 is being downloaded and installed.
2. Download boost from https://www.boost.org/users/download/ and extract it. I'm assuming you're downloading boost 1.74 and extracting to C:/dev/. Please edit the variables below based on the version and location you choose.
Then, set the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to C:\dev\boost_1_74_0. See this guide to understand how to set environment variables on Windows: https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/. I recommend creating a user variable, instead of a system variable.
3. Download cmake from https://cmake.org/download/ and add it to path. That is, add ";C:\Program Files\CMake\bin" (without quotes) to the Path environment variable. If there is no user variable called Path, create one and set it to "C:\Program Files\CMake\bin".
4. Download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and add it to the path. That is, append ";C:\Program Files\Git\cmd" to the Path environment variable.
5. Download Intel oneMKL from https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html. This requires creating an Intel software development account.
In the installer, choose "Custom Installation" and only select the Math Kernel Library.
Create a new environment variable MKLROOT and set it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest
Create a new environment variable MKL_LIB_DIR and set it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest\lib\intel64
6. Open up Powershell (Win+X -> Windows Powershell). Go to any folder you like using the cd command:
cd C:/dev
7. Clone gptoolbox:
git clone https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/
8. Configure the gptoolbox mex projects.
cd gptoolbox/mex
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
9. This may result in an error. If yes, delete FindMATLAB and try again:
rm C:\dev\gptoolbox\mex\external\libigl\external\cgal\Installation\cmake\modules\FindMATLAB.cmake
cmake ..
10. Now, build the mex code:
cmake --build . --config Release
The above step will take a while (up to 30 minutes on a standard laptop). 
11. Copy all executable files to the base folder
cd ..
cp ./build/Release/*.mexw64 .
12. Also copy the required dependencies:
cp C:\dev\gptoolbox\mex\external\libigl\external\gmp\lib\libgmp-10.dll .
cp C:\dev\gptoolbox\mex\external\libigl\external\mpfr\lib\libmpfr-4.dll .
13. Open MATLAB and set up mex. Note that the following commands should be typed in MATLAB, not on Powershell.
mex -setup
mex -setup C++
14. Now, try running a simple program. If MATLAB doesn't crash, you're good to go. Note that the following should be typed in MATLAB, not on Powershell.
cd /dev/gptoolbox/mex
[VT, FT] = wire_mesh([0 0 0; 1 1 1], [1 2], 'PolySize', 6, 'Thickness', 2e-3, 'Solid', false);
