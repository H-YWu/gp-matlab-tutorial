% The fascinating thing about the Schwarz lantern is that, depending on how
% the parameters are refined, the total polygonal area may not converge to
% the cylinder area, no matter how much incredibly fine the mesh is. This
% is very well explained on the Wikipedia page for "Schwarz lantern", which
% uses animations generated with gptoolbox.
%
% Use gptoolbox functions to generate arbitrarily fine Schwarz lanterns and
% compare their areas with that of a cylinder. Try to find both the cases
% where the area diverges, converges to a constant number different from
% the area of the cylinder, and converges to the area of the cylinder.
