# Exercise

Let's use what we have learned about `mex` to write a function which loops over
every face of a triangle mesh and outputs its per-face normal vectors. Compare
its runtime to (1) a for loop in matlab (without `mex`) and (2) the vectorized
impementation of `normals.m`. Which of the three is fastest and why?
