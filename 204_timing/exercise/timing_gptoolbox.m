% Find the runtime complexity as a function of the number of vertices
% for the following gptoolbox functions:
% - discrete_curvatures.m
% - doublearea.m
% - haussdorf.m
% You can use any meshes from these tutorial files to test this on 
% (think: should it matter?).
%
%
% For extra credit (again, not really, there is no credit system), try to
% think yourself of what *you* think the runtime complexity *should be* for
% these functions. For example, read what doublearea.m is supposed to do
% and think how many calculations you would need to do, as a function of
% the mesh size. Then, see if gptoolbox is better (or worse!) than you
% expect.
