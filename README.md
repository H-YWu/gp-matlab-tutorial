# A basic geometry processing tutorial in MATLAB.

This MATLAB tutorial will teach you the basics of geometry processing in
MATLAB using the [gptoolbox library](https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox).
Complete the exercises in order from 001 to 999!

This tutorial also accompanies an SGP 2021 graduate school course.
